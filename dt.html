           Title : Swift and Slow
"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: James 1:19"
Devotion : Apostle James, after being born again, noticed that the Holy Ghost had endowed him with special abilities that he had harnessed to accomplish much in the kingdom of God. These special abilities are to hear swiftly, speak gently, and control anger. He therefore exhorts every Christian to harness these qualities; they are already in the born again Christian, and he or she needs to make a conscious effort to cultivate them. Swift to hear/listening attentively is an ability to fight against dullness to hear; slow to speak is an ability that ensures that the speaker thought carefully before speaking, preventing hastiness in speaking, which leads to mistakes; slow to wrath is an ability of self-control to overcome unnecessary anger that leads to sin. It is vital for every Christian to cultivate these abilities so that he or she can grow to maturity and avoid many mistakes and sins. Dear beloved, have you fully cultivated these special abilities in yourself? Share the word.
