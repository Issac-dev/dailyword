           Title : God More Than a Scientist
"For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: Job 36:27"
Devotion : The opening scripture above was spoken by Job's friend Elihu, who magnified God in his speech to encourage Job. He was of the view that God was more than a scientist, considering how He created the water cycle, which the scientists have now discovered. If God could create the water cycle, then God was more able than scientists to heal Job and, in fact, restore him. Indeed, in the end, Job was healed and restored; God gave him twice as much as he had before. The Word of God is still relevant today. Anybody who doubts the existence of God should go out and look at the sky; it displays the glory of God. Whatever healing you need today just know that Jesus Christ is more able than a scientist to heal you (Matthew 9:2-7). Dear beloved, what did you learn from this article? Share your comments here!
